# Task 3 Completion Report

## Summary

Task 3 has been successfully implemented and tested. All features are working as expected according to the specifications.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Features

#### 1. Updated Main Menu

- ✅ Option 5 (Search by Keywords) added for all users
- ✅ Option 6 (Manage Library) added for library staff only
- ✅ Menu dynamically adjusts based on user role

#### 2. Renew Loan Functionality

- ✅ Command: `renew <book ID>` in Borrow and Return console
- ✅ Extends due date by 5 days
- ✅ Validation: unpaid fines check
- ✅ Validation: loan record existence check
- ✅ Validation: overdue status check (using >= comparison)
- ✅ Validation: already renewed check
- ✅ Renews earliest due date first for multiple copies
- ✅ Tracks renewal status in loan records

#### 3. Search by Keywords

- ✅ Case-insensitive keyword search
- ✅ Multiple keywords separated by commas
- ✅ Matches books with at least one keyword
- ✅ Proper sorting:
  - Number of matched keywords (highest first)
  - Publication year (newest first)
  - Book ID (ascending)
- ✅ Empty keyword list returns 0 results

#### 4. Manage Library Console

- ✅ `report` command - library statistics
- ✅ `add physical` command - add physical book
- ✅ `add online` command - add online book
- ✅ `quit` command - exit console
- ✅ Automatic keyword detection from title
- ✅ Automatic book ID generation (P#### or E####)
- ✅ Keywords sorted alphabetically

#### 5. Fine System Refinement

- ✅ Separate functions for display fines vs. blocking fines
- ✅ Display fines include all fines (returned + active)
- ✅ Blocking fines only include active overdue loans
- ✅ Users can borrow after returning overdue books

## Code Quality

### Linting ✅

- No linting errors detected
- Clean, well-formatted code

### Documentation ✅

- Comprehensive docstrings for all functions
- Clear inline comments
- Usage guide created
- Implementation summary documented

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Validation Priority for Renewal

Follows the specified order:

1. User eligibility (unpaid fines from active loans)
2. Loan validity (record exists)
3. Overdue status (today >= due_date)
4. Renewal status (not already renewed)

### 2. Fine System Design

- `get_user_fines()`: For display (all fines)
- `get_user_unpaid_fines()`: For restrictions (active overdue only)
- This separation allows proper behavior matching the examples

### 3. Overdue Date Comparison

- Uses `>=` comparison: `if today >= due_date`
- Books are overdue on or after their due date
- Prevents renewal on the due date itself

### 4. Keyword Detection Algorithm

- Extracts all existing keywords from books.csv
- Matches whole words (not substrings) in title
- Case-insensitive matching
- Alphabetically sorted results

### 5. Book ID Generation

- Finds maximum existing ID per type (P or E)
- Increments by 1
- Zero-padded to 4 digits (e.g., P0020, E0005)
