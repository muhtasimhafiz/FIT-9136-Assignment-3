# Library Management System - Task 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Completed implementation of a Python-based library management system with user authentication, role-based menus, and comprehensive data management for users, books, and loans.

## Files Implemented

### 1. `user.py` - User Management Module
**Classes:**
- `User` (Abstract Base Class)
  - Abstract methods: `get_max_days()`, `get_max_items()`
  - Common attributes: user_id, password, name, role, department
  - Method: `get_role_display()`

- `Student` (inherits from User)
  - Loan policy: 10 days, 4 items max
  - User ID prefix: 's'

- `Staff` (inherits from User)
  - Loan policy: 14 days, 6 items max
  - User ID prefix: 'e'
  - Special method: `is_library_staff()` - checks if department == "Library"

- `Others` (inherits from User)
  - Loan policy: 7 days, 2 items max
  - User ID prefix: 'o'

**Functions:**
- `load_users(filename)` - Loads users from CSV and returns dictionary of User objects

### 2. `book.py` - Book Management Module
**Classes:**
- `Book`
  - Attributes: book_id, book_type, total_copies, title, author, year, keywords
  - Methods:
    - `is_physical()` - Returns True if book type is 'physical'
    - `is_online()` - Returns True if book type is 'online'

**Functions:**
- `load_books(filename)` - Loads books from CSV and returns dictionary of Book objects

### 3. `task1.py` - Main Program
**Data Loading Functions:**
- `load_loans(loan_file)` - Loads loan records from CSV
- `get_active_loans(loans, user_id=None)` - Filters active loans (no return date)
- `parse_date(date_str)` - Parses dd/mm/yyyy format dates

**Analysis Functions:**
- `get_user_loans_count(loans, user_id)` - Returns (total, physical, online) loan counts
- `get_available_books_count(books, loans)` - Calculates physical books with available copies

**UI Functions:**
- `login(users)` - Handles authentication with 3-attempt limit
- `display_menu(current_user)` - Shows role-based menu
- `view_account_policies(current_user, loans)` - Displays user policies and loan counts
- `view_my_loans(current_user, loans, books)` - Shows active loans sorted by due date
- `library_report(users, books, loans)` - Shows library statistics (Library staff only)

**Main Function:**
- `main(user_file, book_file, loan_file)` - Entry point with login/menu loop

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Login System
- Username and password validation
- 3-attempt limit with countdown messages
- "Sorry you're out of attempts" message after 3rd failure
- Restart login process after lockout
- Type "quit" to exit at login prompt
- Case-insensitive quit detection

### ✅ Role-Based Menus
**All Users (Options 0-3):**
- 0. Quit
- 1. Log out
- 2. View account policies
- 3. View my loans

**Library Staff Only (Additional Option):**
- 4. Library Report

### ✅ Menu Features

#### Option 0: Quit
- Prints "Goodbye!"
- Terminates program

#### Option 1: Log out
- Returns to welcome screen
- Allows new login

#### Option 2: View Account Policies
Displays:
- User role and name
- Maximum loan days
- Maximum items allowed
- Current active loans (total, physical, online)

Format: `[Role] [Name]. Policies: maximum of [X] days, [Y] items. Current loans: [Z] ([P] physical / [O] online).`

#### Option 3: View My Loans
Displays:
- Count of active loans
- List of loans sorted by due date
- Each loan shows: book_id, title, author, year, due date

Format: `[N]. [BookID] '[Title]' by [Author] ([Year]). Due date: [DD/MM/YYYY].`

#### Option 4: Library Report (Library Staff Only)
Displays:
- Total users with breakdown by role
- Total books with breakdown by type
- Available physical books count

Format:
```
Library report
- [N] users, including [X] student(s), [Y] staff, and [Z] others.
- [M] books, including [P] physical book(s) ([A] currently available) and [E] online book(s).
```

### ✅ Data Management

#### User Policies
- **Students:** 10 days max, 4 items max
- **Staff:** 14 days max, 6 items max
- **Others:** 7 days max, 2 items max

#### Book Types
- **Physical books:** Book ID starts with 'P', has copy count
- **Online books:** Book ID starts with 'E', copies always 0

#### Loan Tracking
- Active loans: return_date is empty
- Returned loans: return_date has value
- Sorting: By due date (earliest first)

#### Available Books Calculation
- Physical books only (online books always available)
- Available = total_copies - active_loans_for_that_book
- Count books with at least 1 available copy

### ✅ Access Control
- Library Report (Option 4) only visible to Library department staff
- Non-library staff don't see Option 4
- Invalid menu choices silently re-prompt

### ✅ Error Handling
- Invalid user IDs
- Wrong passwords
- Invalid menu choices (re-prompt without error message)
- Graceful handling of CSV data

## Test Coverage

### Automated Tests (`test_task1.py`)
10 comprehensive test suites covering:
1. ✅ User loading from CSV
